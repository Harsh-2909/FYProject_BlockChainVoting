# Final Year Project: Object Detection
> Final Year Project by Group 38, UEM, Kolkata
- Base Principle: Object Detection using Tensor Flow 
- Application: Detecting 2 dimensional shapes 
- Some detectable shapes: Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Octagon, Parallelogram 
- Still in progress//developing stages

##### Possible Further expansion:
- Dynamic Detection 
- Identifying angles between two edges (Might help in math solving apps)
- Identfying radius and diameter from an image (Might need fine tuning according to zoom)
- Integrating graph theories and help identifying types of graphs
